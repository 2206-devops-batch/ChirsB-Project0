## Image Steganography

> Steganography is the technique of hiding secret data within an ordinary, non-secret, file or message in order to avoid detection; the secret data is then extracted at its destination. The use of steganography can be combined with encryption as an extra step for hiding or protecting data.

---

## Audio Steganography

> Steganography is the technique used to transmit hidden information by modifying an audio signal in an imperceptible manner. It is the science of hiding some secret text or audio information in a host message. The host message before steganography and stego message after steganography have the same characteristics.

### LSB (Least Significant Bit) Algorithm

> LSB algorithm is a classic Steganography method used to conceal the existence of secret data inside a “public” cover. The LSB or “Least Significant Bit”, in computing terms, represents the bit at the unit’s place in the binary representation of a number.
